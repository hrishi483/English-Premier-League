# English Premier League Dashboard

## Overview

This project is an interactive dashboard that provides a comprehensive analysis of the English Premier League (EPL) season. The dashboard is designed to offer insights into team performance, player statistics, and attendance figures for the league. 
It encompasses various domains, including web scraping, data analysis with Pandas, dashboard creation with Plotly, and a user-friendly front-end developed using Streamlit.

## Domains Covered

### 1. Web Scraping

We have collected data from [fbref.com](https://fbref.com), a reliable source for EPL statistics. The web scraping process involved extracting valuable information, such as team performance, player statistics, and attendance figures,
to create a well-rounded dataset for analysis.

### 2. Data Analysis with Pandas

Pandas is utilized to preprocess and analyze the scraped data. We've cleaned, transformed, and organized the dataset to derive meaningful insights about EPL teams and players. This analysis forms the basis for the interactive dashboard's content.

### 3. Dashboard Creation with Plotly

The core of this project is the creation of a dynamic and informative dashboard using the Plotly library. We've designed professional and visually appealing charts, including bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts, to represent EPL data. 
The dashboard offers a user-friendly interface for exploring EPL statistics.

### 4. Front-End Development with Streamlit

Streamlit is employed to develop the front-end of the dashboard. It provides a simple yet powerful way to turn data scripts into shareable web apps. The Streamlit framework ensures a smooth and intuitive user experience.
